How to Manually add reads to CRUX databases
Written By Emily Curd

A bash script will follow in a few days / weeks, but in the mean time here is how you do it on your own.

You will need:
1. A fasta file containing your reads.  I am not sure that it matters if they contain primers, or extend beyond the region of the metabarcode. I suspect that it does not matter, but if you test this please let me know what you find.  It will matter if they are shorter in length than the metabarcode minus the primers. If there is a read that is very similar to your custom read but is longer and has a better alignment score in muscle, you will get the hit from the close relative rather than the hit from your custom read.

The file format is as follow:

>name_of_your_read_1
aatgcgatcgatcgatcagatacgactacgactacgtagcatagatcagat
>name_of_your_read_2
tacgactacgtagcatagatcagataatgcgatcgatcgatcagatacgac


2. A text file for your reads. You will need fields for 7 levels of taxonomy: superkingdom,phylum,class,order,family,genus,species.  The format is as follows:

name_of_your_read_1      Eukaryota;Chordata;Aves;Apodiformes;Apodidae;Apus;Apus apus
name_of_your_read_2      Eukaryota;Chordata;Mammalia;NA;Bovidae;Bison;Bison bison


3. a CRUX database <metabarcode>_.fasta file (filtered or unfiltered is up to you)

4. a CRUX database <metabarcode>_taxonomy.txt file that matches the fasta file

5. Access to bowtie2


This is what you need to do in bash (replace <metabarcode> with the name of your metabarcode (e.g. CO1)) :

mkdir -p path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>
mkdir -p path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_bowtie2_database
mkdir -p path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_fasta_and_taxonomy

1. cat path/to/your/custom_reads.fasta path/to/your/old/crux/db/<metabarcode>_.fasta >> path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_fasta_and_taxonomy/<metabarcode>_.fasta

2. cat path/to/your/custom_taxonomy.txt path/to/your/old/crux/db/<metabarcode>_taxonomy.txt >> path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_fasta_and_taxonomy/<metabarcode>_taxonomy.txt

3. bowtie2-build -f path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_fasta_and_taxonomy/<metabarcode>_.fasta path_to_directory_where_you_want_your_new_Crux_library/<metabarcode>/<metabarcode>_bowtie2_database/<metabarcode>_bowtie2_index

* if on hoffman2 run ```module load bowtie2``` first then run the command above
* if on merced add the full path to bowtie2-build ```/opt/anaconda3/bin/bowtie2-build```

Now you are good to go, just add it to your anacapa database folder and see what happens.
